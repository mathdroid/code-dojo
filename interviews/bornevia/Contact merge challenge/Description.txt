CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
Company A has a corporate-wide database of their customers, stored in a csv format.
This company has been running for decades, so their database has been
accumulating for quite some time now.

Recently, Company A decided that they want to reduce the size of their database by
merging all of the duplicate entries.

As you can see here, their database is clean, however the problem was, every row
of customer info only contains either their email address, Facebook username, or Twitter
username. So, there will be duplicate rows for customers who have more than
one information. For example there are two entries for Rita Greer; one
that contains her email address, and one that contains her Facebook username.

Recently, Company A decided that they want to reduce the size of their database by
merging all of the duplicate entries.

Your job as a software engineer is to develop a program that will take the csv file
above, combine the customers based on their names, and output the results into another file.

RULES AND ASSUMPTIONS
- Preserve the header row
- Your program must begin with reading a file and end with writing to the resulting output file
- Your output must be sorted by the customers' name alphabetically
- Email may contain mixed of lowercase and uppercase letters, convert all email to lower case in the output
- Values may contain leading and/or trailing white spaces which consist of spaces, tabs, or mixed of both. Don't forget to trim them in your output.
- Your program must be fast, efficient, and able to handle extremely large input files
- You can assume that there is no comma and quotation mark in any of the values
- Reject the input file by throwing an error if there are extra columns in any of the rows
- Reject the input file by throwing an error if there are missing columns in any of the rows
- Reject the input file by throwing an error if the email is not in a valid format in any of the rows
- Use any programming language of your choice, but C-like languages, such as Java or JavaScript are preferred
